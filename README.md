****Abstract

In the UK new sources of administrative social science data are unfolding 
rapidly but the quality of these new forms of data for sociological research 
is yet to be established. We investigate the quality and consistency of the 
parental occupational information that is officially recorded on administrative 
birth records by undertaking a comparison with information collected from the 
same parents in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). We detect a large amount 
of missing information in the birth records and a range of inconsistencies. We 
present an empirical analysis of MCS data using parental social class measures 
derived both from the birth records and the survey to assess the effects of 
these discrepancies. We conclude that parental occupational information from 
administrative birth records should not be assumed, a priori, to be suitable 
for sociological analyses and that further research should be undertaken into 
their consistency and accuracy.
